This is a rubik's cube timer and scrambler a friend and I made in our Grade 12 Comp Sci course. It was created to be a desktop version
of one of our favourite web-only rubik's cube timers - cstimer.net. So all the credit for this idea goes to that site and its creators.

The UI was implemented by me (Taimur Khan) and so were all the algorithms that dealt with file handling, sorting of files, and times
The UI includes literally everything that you see
The algorithms for the scramble itself was created by my partner, Chris

I also created the actual timer itself and the formatting of the timer. This includes dealing with minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
(Which was a huge pain btw).
