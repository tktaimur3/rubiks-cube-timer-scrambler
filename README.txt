This is a rubik's cube timer and scrambler a friend and I made in our Grade 12 Comp Sci course.

The UI was implemented by me (Taimur) and so were all the algorithms that dealt with sorting of files and times
The UI includes literally everything that you see
The algorithms for the scramble itself was created by my partner, Chris

I also created the actual timer itself and the formatting of the timer. This includes dealing with minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
(Which was a huge pain btw).
